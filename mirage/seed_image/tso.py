"""
This module contains code for adding a source with time-varying signal
to a seed image


Inputs:
* seed image (counts/second)
* PSF scaled to counts/second for given magnitude
* coordinates within aperture to place the PSF, coordinates in the PSF that correspond to the area on the PSF to use
* hdf5 file of the source

method:
* step along the light curve in time, at a cadence equal to the frame time.
* for each step, integrate under the light curve to find out the relative brightness of the source
* scale the input PSF based on integration results
* scale the seed image to be in counts/frame
* add PSF to the seed image
* add seed image to the signal in the seed image corresponding to the previous frame
* add Poisson noise/cosmic rays
* move on to the next frame

outputs:
* 4d seed image with time varying source (similar to moving targetsâ€™ 4d seed image

    Will there ever be a case when more than one object is varying in brightness?
    It seems unlikely.
    We can make lists of varying sources I suppose and then pass the lists to the

    time and creating a 4D seed image, we don't want to do that multiple times
