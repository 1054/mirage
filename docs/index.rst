Mirage is a Python package that creates realistic simulated data products for JWST's NIRCam, NIRISS, and FGS instruments. The output files are in a format that is as close as possible to that which real JWST data will have, which allows Mirage data to be used for data analysis software development and testing.




Contributors

Mirage has been developed by Bryan Hilbert, Kevin Volk, Lauren Chambers, Johannes Sahlmann, Shannon Osborne, and Marshall Perrin. It is based on early NIRISS simulator software written by Kevin Volk.
